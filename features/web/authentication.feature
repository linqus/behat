    In order to gain access to the site management area
    As an admin
    I need to be able to login and logout

    Scenario: Loggin in
        Given there is an admin user "admin2" with password "admin"
        And I am on "/"

        And I fill in "Username" with "admin2"
        And I fill in "Password" with "admin"
        And I press "Login"
        #And print last response
